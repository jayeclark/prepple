![Prepple Logo](./prepple.png)
## Description
Prepple is a web and mobile application in development that helps job seekers unlock their full interview potential through AI-assisted answer planning, virtual interview practice, and social feedback gathering. It includes a number of features to help prepare for virtual and in-person interviews:
* Plan STAR, CARL, or SOAR style responses to behavioral interview questions and receive AI feedback on the content, tone, and clarity of the planned response
* Practice answering behavioral questions 'on camera' and receive AI feedback and suggestions for improvement
* Save practice videos to track improvement over time
* Share videos with friends and mentors and receive feedback and suggestions for improvement
* Create a 'video resume' and promote yourself to recruiters
* Recruiters: discover talented candidates through AI-assisted candidate matching
